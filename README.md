# SuperReadKey
Wrapper for $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey. 
Enables $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey to accept Single AND Multiple Characters.

## Welcome to SuperReadKey!
This was born from a desire to have Read-Host accept single characters without necessitating an Enter inside of my menu system "RunMAhStuff".  I quickly needed a way to have both single and multiple character input.  I could have easily switched between $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey and Read-Host, but I wanted it to work in a SINGLE function.
